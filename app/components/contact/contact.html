	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<h4>Why have you created CompeteLeague?</h4>
	Lots of people play League of Legends for tons of games and hours, amassing thousands of ranked games per season, learning multiple different champions and multiple different roles through experience. Through this dedication of time people gain ELO and climb higher and higher until they reach a plateau, the point at which they cannot seem to overcome the talents they're pooled against on a consistent basis. It is the belief of our staff at CompeteLeague that many people hit this plateau stage when their game progression knowledge and team coordination are capped by lack of consistent 5v5 competition, an experience that is hard to come across and organize. To this end we at CompeteLeague have set up and are running three different tiered leagues designed to give players looking to take their game to the next level an environment in which to experience a competitive scene. We&rsquo;re also here to create that LCS style experience so that any players of every level can experience what it's like to perform for an audience, and to entertain those who want to watch and interact. Whether you&rsquo;re between seasons and missing your LCS fix or just looking to overdose on League of Legends content we&rsquo;re here for you!
	<br>
	<h4>How do these leagues simulate a competitive scene?</h4>
	To create a competitive environment we provide players with an organized league, an audience for those in the Premier Leagues, and of course prizes to strive for. We schedule and set up the lobbies for each of the games for the league, and have penalties for teams that are late break our ruleset in any other manner. Each week four of each of our leagues games are streamed and casted by many of our staff on Twitch.tv/CompeteLeague to an audience that ranges from 40 to 120 on a consistent basis. Our community often interacts with players following their games in twitch chat, providing feedback and giving a real sense of the people who are watching. At the end of the seasons, in a similar manner to Riots LCS, the top 6 teams in the league are entered into a playoff to determine the final rankings of the season and determine who wins our first, second, third, and fourth place prizes. Players not in the Premier Leagues may not be streamed for the audience, but they do still have the benefits of organized competition and practice, as well as
	<br>
	<h4>What are these prizes?</h4>

	</table>
	<br>
	These prizes are awarded to each player in the top 4 teams from the playoffs of each league (not split between members). This prize pool had a total $2,975 to be won!
	The upcoming season is our first with running our open leagues, but we do plan to have prizes for them.
	<br>
	<h4>Where do I sign my team up?</h4>
	Simply register with the site and follow the instructions in your account page!
	<br>
	<h4>How soon will we be playing?</h4>
	This depends on when you have signed up. If you have signed up prior to the initial placement tournament we're having to attain the best 10 teams for the Premier Leagues of each tier then you can expect to be a part of that placement tournament at the end of January.
	Following that point, if you sign up with your team you will automatically be placed into the Open League related to the highest Solo Queue ranked player of your team. You'll be playing the week after the upcoming weeks games for your league, as that's when our schedule adjusts for new team entries. As such your first games will be between 7 and 14 days from when you sign up depending on when you do.
	<br>
	<h4>We&rsquo;re all signed up, now what?</h4>
	We use the time before your first games to vet your teams for smurfs so we&rsquo;ll be doing that first.  Your account schedule should detail when your first match-up is, and until then practice with your team and have fun!
	<br>
	<h4>Wait, vetting for smurfs?</h4>
	Yes, unsurprisingly with prizes come smurf attempts to take them instead of entering at their own level in a fair attempt. We have a very effective method of knowing what summoners are smurfing that we&rsquo;ve used over several seasons to eliminate unfair competition. You should note that if we do catch you trying to enter as a smurf and we uncover you, you will be blacklisted and we will not allow any team you&rsquo;re a part of to enter even at your actual ELO level, so best to just go for your ELO first time eh?
	<br>
	<h4>I just looked up one of the players in the Silver league and they&rsquo;re Gold! WTF</h4>
	If it&rsquo;s part way through the season sometimes players on the teams competing in our leagues go up SoloQ divisions in the meantime. This is very common actually due to the amounts of practice and increased understanding of the game from participating in our league. Even if the player in the Silver league has improved so much that their account is in Diamond now you can rest assured that they were Silver and in the right division at the start of the season.
	<br>
	<h4>Diamond league I can understand, but who would want to watch lower ELO leagues?</h4>
	I&rsquo;m sure we all look back fondly on the LCS days of wombo-combo bloodbaths and death-oriented play of seasons past, but nowadays with the meta shifted distinctly towards objective-based gameplay many games have turned into low, sometimes single digit, stale tower killing simulators. Our lower ELO games consistently show a lot more action and terror than displayed in the current LCS (sometimes so much our cameraman can&rsquo;t keep up, bear with him the poor fellow). If you&rsquo;re still not convinced, you don&rsquo;t have to be! Feel free to only tune in for our Diamond league games, our stream is at your discretion.
	<br>
	<h4>How long is a season? How many games are in a season? WHAT IS A SEASON?</h4>
	Each of our Premier Leagues holds 10 teams who play 2 games a week over a period of approximately 2 months. Teams will play one another 2 times throughout the duration of this season, and at the end the highest 6 teams in the rankings will enter a playoff elimination tournament to go for the winning spots. The playoff will be single game elimination until the semi-finals and final which will be best of 3  matches. You can check out the full schedules for Bronze/Silver, Gold/Platinum, and Diamond Premier Leagues  via the leagues tab in the nav bar.
	<br>
	<h4>What if I'm signing up between seasons?</h4>
	We usually take some time between seasons to organize new plans, search for new sponsors and opportunities, and take a short break from the administrative work. We&rsquo;ll be back shortly though and rest assured you&rsquo;ll know when the leagues are back up and running through emails, and announcements on our social medias.
	<br>
	<h4>Man I&rsquo;m so excited! Wait what server is this on?</h4>
	At the moment CompeteLeague is only on the NA and EUW servers. If you&rsquo;re on EUNE, BR, TR, RU, LAN, LAS, or OCE, and you want us to expand to your area we need your help! If you&rsquo;re interested in joining a team creating a CompeteLeague competition in your region you can apply to help via our jobs below.
